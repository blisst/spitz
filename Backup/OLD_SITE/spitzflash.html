The meats are slow-roasted to perfection in our custom vertical broilers, which allow their juices to percolate and self-infuse for a product of unmatched taste and texture. Only when you order do we shave the meat into paper-thin strips and stuff them into a Panini toasted pita pocket. This delectable combination is then topped-off with your choice of garden-fresh offerings including lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, peppers, jalapenos, hummus, cool tzaziki sauce and a spicy chili sauce.  If your mouth is watering you're not alone.  Get in on something that millions of people around the world over already enjoy.the Döner Kebab.  Available only at Spitz.

Legend has it that the earliest Döner Kebabs (Turkish for "rotating roast meat") were the favorite meal of the nomadic tribes inhabiting the vast reaches of Asia Minor. It was traditionally made of mutton and served with rice and spicy sauce. The story of the Döner Kebab migration from Asia Minor to Europe is a tale far too complicated and convoluted for these pages.

The modern Döner Kebab has European origins, first appearing in Berlin-Kreuzberg, Germany in the 1970's and spreading rapidly throughout Europe. Spitz's Döner Kebab is based on a version found in Madrid, Spain, where Kebab shops are as ubiquitous as Spanish Tapas bars, with up to three or four shops on a single block. Unlike other European Kebab shops, the Spanish version uses an electric knife to slice meat into paper-thin strips, giving it an unmatched taste and texture.

It was during a stay in Madrid that Bryce first encountered and grew to love the Döner Kebab and envisioned SPITZ. "We have adapted the Spanish model to fit the American palate, keeping the slow roasting custom vertical broilers that allow the meat's natural juices to percolate and self-infuse while adding the Panini toasted pita pocket with assorted toppings including lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, peppers, jalapeños, hummus, cool tzaziki sauce and a sweet and spicy chili sauce."

Co-founder Bryce Rademan swears that Spitz' gelato and sorbetto is the best in the world: "even as I traveled throughout Italy, trying nearly every gelato and sorbetto I could find, I have never tasted any better than ours." Time Magazine confirms Bryce's findings, calling it "the absolute best ice cream in the universe".  Rivaling the Döner Kebab in taste, quality, and mind blowing flavor, Spitz' gelato and sorbetto contains no added air.  This gives it a silky-smooth density, texture, and flavor that is incomparable with most gelatos, which add anywhere between 8 to 20 percent air to their mixtures. 

Lower in fat than traditional ice cream, Spitz gelato flavors rotate constantly and include such favorites as Tiramisu, Burgundy Cherry, Crème Brulée, Double Espresso, Green Tea, Pistachio White Chocolate, and Hazelnut Espresso Cheesecake.  For our health conscious customers, we carry fat-free gelato flavors like Fudge Brownie Sundae Swirl, Fresh Banana Walnut, and Mocha Chip.  

If you're ready for a truly incredible experience, try our all natural fat-free sorbettos.  Made from 80 to 90 percent high quality fruit, it's like biting into the freshest, most succulent delicacies on the planet.all on the tip of your spoon!  With rotating flavors that include Strawberry Champagne, Mango, Lemon Ginger, Passion Fruit and Blackberry Merlot, you'll leave guilt-free and happy! 

Paired with our ultra-premium organic coffee and a complimentary cinnamon-sugar pita strip, these gelatos and sorbettos are sure to excite even the most discerning of palates. 

In January, 2005 Spitz co-founder Bryce Rademan arrived in Madrid, Spain for a five month semester abroad.  Tired and hungry from the long journey, he set out in search of food.  As he meandered down a quaint cobblestone road, an intoxicatingly delicious smell wafted through his nose. Unavoidably drawn to it, he found himself face to face with one of the most delectable looking foods he had ever seen: the Döner Kebab.  By the end of the first bite he knew that he had found something so scrumptious and unique that it would have been downright selfish not to share it with his fellow Americans. 
 
Henceforth he began to cultivate a relationship with the shop's owner, who graciously explained both the recipes and process of making Döner Kebab.  By the time his semester came to an end Spitz was much more than an idea-it was a vision. 
 
Upon his return, Bryce teamed up with longtime friend Robert Wicklund, who helped solidify the business plan through his attention to detail and grounded realism.  Within a week of their 2005 graduation from Occidental College, they had secured the necessary startup capital and signed a lease at 2506 Colorado Boulevard, making Spitz a reality.  

Although their restaurant is young, Robert and Bryce truly believe that the freshness, taste, and quality of their homemade recipes will help it grow into a Los Angeles institution.  For more on Spitz' superior food, service, and ambiance, you'll have to come on over to Eagle Rock and experience it for yourself.
