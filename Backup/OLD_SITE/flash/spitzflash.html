No doubt, you are wondering what we are serving at 2506 Colorado Boulevard. The answer is as simple as it is delicious.  Spitz is Southern California's home for the Döner Kebab, a delectable sandwich made from either minced lamb and beef, ground chicken or falafel. The meats are slow-roasted to perfection in our custom vertical broilers, which allow their juices to percolate and self-infuse for a product of unmatched taste and texture. Only when you order do we shave the meat into paper-thin strips and stuff them into a Panini toasted pita pocket. This delectable combination is then topped-off with your choice of garden-fresh offerings including lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, peppers, jalapenos, hummus, cool tzaziki sauce and a spicy chili sauce.  If your mouth is watering you're not alone.  Get in on something that millions of people around the world over already enjoy.the Döner Kebab.  Available only at Spitz.

Legend has it that the earliest Döner Kebabs (Turkish for "rotating roast meat") were the favorite meal of the nomadic tribes inhabiting the vast reaches of Asia Minor. It was traditionally made of mutton and served with rice and spicy sauce. The story of the Döner Kebab migration from Asia Minor to Europe is a tale far too complicated and convoluted for these pages.

The modern Döner Kebab has European origins, first appearing in Berlin-Kreuzberg, Germany in the 1970's and spreading rapidly throughout Europe. Spitz's Döner Kebab is based on a version found in Madrid, Spain, where Kebab shops are as ubiquitous as Spanish Tapas bars, with up to three or four shops on a single block. Unlike other European Kebab shops, the Spanish version uses an electric knife to slice meat into paper-thin strips, giving it an unmatched taste and texture.

It was during a stay in Madrid that Bryce first encountered and grew to love the Döner Kebab and envisioned SPITZ. "We have adapted the Spanish model to fit the American palate, keeping the slow roasting custom vertical broilers that allow the meat's natural juices to percolate and self-infuse while adding the Panini toasted pita pocket with assorted toppings including lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, peppers, jalapeños, hummus, cool tzaziki sauce and a sweet and spicy chili sauce."
