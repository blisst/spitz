            <h2>The Story Behind Spitz</h2>
            <p class="hidden-phone hidden-tablet"><strong>The Story</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-top: -5px;">Founders Bryce Rademan and Robert Wicklund laid the groundwork for Spitz while studying at Occidental College in Los Angeles.  Discovered while on a semester abroad in Spain, Rademan fell in love with Döner Kebab.  It was sold on virtually every street corner and he was hooked.  Upon arriving back in the US, Rademan immediately became infatuated with the idea of bringing Döner Kebab to L.A.  In the spring of 2005 he teamed up with Wicklund and they ultimately opened their first location a mile from Occidental six months after graduating.
            </p>
            <p>Together Rademan and Wicklund have pioneered a restaurant concept that has transformed a Mediterranean street food into a California-fresh, flavorful and healthy culinary sensation.  This means that everything is made in-house from fresh ingredients and unique recipes.  The ambiance, from music to art, is inspirational yet comfortable.  And customer service, from greeting to goodbye, is sincere.  We look forward to serving you soon - and as always - rock the kebab!</p>

            <p><strong>What's a Döner Kebab?</strong></p>
            <p>Döner Kebab (pronounced du-ner-keh-bob) is a Turkish phrase that literally translates as "rotating meat", not to be confused with "shish kebab" which means "skewered meat."</p>
            <p>Spitz's Döner Kebabs are made with freshly minced lamb and beef or chicken which is then cooked on a rotating vertical broiler to allow its juices to drip down and caramelize on the surface. The meat is shaved off into paper-thin strips and stuffed into sandwiches, wraps or salads with house-made sauces, toppings and sides.  The result is a delicious yet healthy cuisine loved the world over and finally brought to you here in the US by Spitz.</p>
