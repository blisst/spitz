              <h2>The Story (THE FOOD!!)</h2>
              <p>The groundwork for Spitz was laid in 2005 at Occidental College in Los Angeles.  Founder Bryce Rademan returned from a semester studying abroad in Europe with dreams of bringing the Mediterranean street food (specifically döner kebab or “spit” of rotating meat) he fell in love with home to the U.S.  That spring he teamed up with close friend Robert Wicklund and both set aside their law school ambitions to follow their entrepreneurial instincts.</p>
              <p>Rademan and Wicklund set about learning everything they could about the cuisine and tested countless versions of recipes in their school’s kitchens... taking what they had eaten every night on the streets of Europe and combining it with the California freshness, color and flavor they were inspired by in Los Angeles.  They hashed out a business plan and on April 12th, 2006 the first Spitz location was opened a mile from their alma mater.</p>
              <p>Here in Salt Lake City high-school friends of Bryce, Josh Hill and Tanner Slizeski, dreamt about bringing the Spitz food they had fallen in love with while visiting Los Angeles back home to Utah.  They knew their fellow Utahns would embrace the amazing combination of distinctive street food creations, craft beer, housemade sangria and unique atmosphere.</p>
              <p>Josh and Tanner opened their first Spitz in downtown SLC in October of 2013.  With support from a strong community of friends, family and local businesses Spitz quickly became a Salt Lake City sensation, recognized by many local media outlets as one of the best new concepts of the year.  Their second location in Sugarhouse opened in July of 2015.</p>
              <p>In the words of Tanner: “<i>booya</i>”.</p> 
              <p><strong>Thank you Döner Crew…  Keep rocking the kebab</strong></p>
